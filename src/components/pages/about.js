              <p>
              I am a currently a student at the Bottega DevCamp coding bootcamp. I am striving and working everyday to become a full time software developer. One of my biggest passions in the field is web development. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I feel I am best suited as a front end web developer, however I am very comfortable with a lot of backend implementations as well. I am very fond of the React.js library and work with it almost daily. I have a lot of experience working with API's in React and Javascript. Nothing makes me happier than a great looking website that performs even better.
                I do have experience with some other coding languages, frameworks, and technologies including:
                <ul className="technology-list">
                  <li>Vanilla JavaScript</li>
                  <li>NodeJS</li>
                  <li>HTML</li>
                  <li>CSS</li>
                  <li>Python</li>
                  <li>MYSQL</li>
                  <li>UML</li>
                  <li>UI Design</li>
                  <li>Git</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                I have many small projects I have built using these various technologies which range from a standard full responsive navbar, to a webscraper built using python. Some of my bigger projects include a fully functioning search engine for the Daily Smarty API which was built using ReactJS and Redux. 
                I built an eCommerce frontend using the same React and Redux as well. I recently finished building an API in NodeJS with login and full CRUD capabilities. My current project is a capstone project for the Bottega DevCamp course. The project is going to be a fully functioning bug tracking system.
                This system will connect with the previously mentioned API. The UI will feature a full user dashboard, bug sharing within an organization, and full CRUD capability with bugs and comments.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have am very intrigued by the endless amounts of knowledge in the tech field that is available to learn. I am very open to any opportunity to learn and grow as a developer, and I feel I can be a very valuable asset to a development team.
