              I am a currently a student at the Bottega DevCamp coding bootcamp. I am striving and working everyday to become a full time software developer. One of my biggest passions in the field is web development. 
              </p>
              <p>I feel I am best suited as a front end web developer, however I am very comfortable with a lot of backend implementations as well. I am very fond of the React.js library and work with it almost daily. I have a lot of experience working with API's in React and Javascript. Nothing makes me happier than a great looking website that performs even better.</p>
              <p>If you are looking for someone to build your next website for your new business, or even a blog website you are in the right spot. Hop on over to my contact page and lets talk about your idea's! I am always looking to learn new skills and push my creativity so any challenge is welcome. </p>
