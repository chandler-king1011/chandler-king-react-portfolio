                <h2>What can you expect from me?</h2>
                <p>
                    As a potential employer or client you can expect a few very specific qualities from me. As a professional I define myself in three words. 
                    I am extemely driven, and I am so passionate about the software development world. Staying on a strong learning curve, and becoming the best developer I can be motivate me everyday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another strong skill I have crafted over my professional career, and my development journey is adaptability. This is something I have improved immensely in the last few years. 
                    I feel this is an essential trait for developers. Instead of getting stuck in my own ways I really strive to embrace change, and fresh perspectives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly I am a very persistent person. In both my career and personal life I do not give up easy. This has helped me unequivocally in terms of learning to code. 
                    Programming is hard, and it has revealed to me some great qualities I possess. Persistance is no exception.
